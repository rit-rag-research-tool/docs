- Session Renewal Mechanism:

Ensure that there is a mechanism to extend session validity based on user activity to improve user experience without compromising security.

- User Account Lockout:

Add logic to handle account lockout after multiple failed login attempts to prevent brute-force attacks.

- Logout Handling:
Include clear steps for handling both manual and automatic session termination (timeout due to inactivity or logging out).

- Email Verification for New Users:

It might be helpful to explicitly include an email verification after registration before allowing login, but we could also defer this step just locking some things behind verifing there email.
